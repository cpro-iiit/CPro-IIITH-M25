# CS0.101 Computer Programming Syllabus

## Prerequisite Course / Knowledge: 

Basic high school mathematics. 

## Course Outcomes (COs): 

After completion of this course successfully, the students will be able to... 

- CO-1: Demonstrate an understanding of computer programming language concepts like variables, data types, conditional, loop, print statements and functions.  

- CO-2: Ability to use pointers, arrays, initialization, dynamic memory allocation and use gdb to debug issues with the code. 

- CO-3: Design and implement algorithms using recursing, iteration with specific use cases like sorting. 

- CO-4:  Design structured data storage using structs, and read/write them to hard disk using file I/O 

- CO-5: Ability to analyze the complexity of the solution offered in terms of memory and runtime and choose efficient alternatives. 

- CO-6: Develop large scale programs using multiple files, header files and make. 

## Detailed Syllabus: 

- Unit 1: Basic computer organization, High level programming languages, assemble code, binary instructions, compilers. Program editing, compilation and execution cycle.
