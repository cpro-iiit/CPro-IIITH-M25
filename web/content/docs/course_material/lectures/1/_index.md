## What this Course is about?

![bg right:50% w:500](code_spell.jpeg)

- Genie needs to be instructed precisely, otherwise it will not respond!

- It will precisely do, what you told it to do! If you meant something else and that was your problem.

- Genie only understand a language, which has no scope for confusion/ambiguity.

# Intro to C Programming

---
## Hello World! C Program
`main.c` file. Try it out at https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/ 
```c
// 1. This line is a comment that is ignored by compiler.

// 2. include standard library for input/output. Allows to print to shell
#include <stdio.h> 

// 3. execution start inside this **function** named main. 
int main() 
{ // start of main function

    // 4. prints to the shell
    printf("Hello, world\n");
    return 0; /* 5. returns integer 0 */

} // end of main function
```

---

## Running the Program

1. Run gcc compiler to get executable file `main`
```gcc main.c -o main```
2. Run the executable `main`
```./main```

## What just happened?

---
## Using Makefile to do it together

1. Create a file `Makefile` (one time step)
```make
// Makefile
run: 
    gcc main.c -o main
    ./main
```

2. run `make run`

Next time, after you modify `main.c`, only `make run` needs to be done.

## Tresure Hunt/Dumb charades!

- Dont be afraid to make guesses!
- Dont be afraid to try out guesses! 
- Failed guess gives clues. Learn from them!
- You will eventually learn to make more clever guesses.
