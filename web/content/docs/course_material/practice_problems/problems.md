# Practice Problems


## 1. Cycles in a permutation

Let $\pi:\\{1,\cdots, n\\} \rightarrow \\{1,\cdots, n\\}$ be permutation (that is a one-one onto function). 
The cycle containing 1 is the sequence of numbers
$$1\qquad \pi(1)\qquad \pi(\pi(1))\qquad \pi(\pi(\pi(1)))\qquad \cdots$$
Notice that the sequence is periodic (Why?)  and the period is called the size of the cycle containing 1. Similarly one can define the cycle containing 2, 3 etc. 
Write a program to take $n$ and a permutation of $\\{1,\cdots,n\\}$ as inputs and print all the cycles (you can stop at the period).    

For example:   
For input 4 and permutation 2 3 4 1 (ie $\pi(1) = 2, \pi(2) = 3, \pi(3) = 4, \pi(4) = 1$), it should output 1->2->3->4->1.  
For input 4 and permutation 1 2 3 4, (ie the identity permutation) it should output 1->1, 2->2, 3->3, 4->4.  
For input 4 and permutation 2 1 4 3 (ie $\pi(1) = 2, \pi(2) = 1, \pi(3) = 4, \pi(4) = 3$), it should output 1->2->1, 3->4->3.  



## 2. Cycles in a LinkedList

In a linked list, its possible to have a cycle in the nodes. That is, while iterating through the nodes, a node could be there whose next pointer is pointing to a previous node. 

Write a C program which takes linked list as input and checks if it has a cycle.   

Hint: You can add extra fields into the Node struct, for aiding this program.  

For example:  
On input linked list 1->2->3->4->5->6->3, the program should print true.  
On input linked list 1->2->3->4->5->6->NULL, the program should print false.

## 4. Enumerating Sets

Write a C program which takes $n$, $k$, and some $n$ numbers $a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n$ as inputs and 
prints all subsets of them of size $k$.   

Example:  
On input $n=4, k =2$ and $2,4,6,8$ it should output  
```
{2, 4}, {2, 6}, {2, 8}, {4, 6}, {4, 8}, {6, 8}
```

## 5. Recursively Enumerating Permutations


Consider all arrangements of $k$ items
   from $n$ objects. For $n=3, k=2$, they
   are $12, 21,13,31,23,32$. The number
   of such arrangements is 
   $$^nP_k = n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+2)(n-k+1).$$ 
   Bellow is a program which when given $n,k$
   as input, prints all arragements of $k$
   items from $n$ objects.

## 8. Checking Bipartiteness
Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, it is said to be bipartite if the vertex set $V$ can be partitioned into two sets $V_1,V_2$ (such that $V_1 \cup V_2 = V$ and $V_1 \cap V_2 = \emptyset$), such that there is no edge in $E$ which has one endpoint in $V_1$ and another endpoint in $V_2$. 

Write a program, which takes a graph as input and checks if it is bipartite.


Note: Runtime of the algorithm doesnt matter, but it should output the correct answer.

## 9. Colorings of a Graph
Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, a *coloring* of the graph using $\{R,G,B\}$ is an assignment of these colors for every vertex, such that there is no edge in $E$ which has the same color in both end points. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring).

Write a program, which takes a graph as input and outputs a coloring of the graph with $\{R,G,B\}$ colors.


Note: Runtime of the algorithm doesnt matter, but it should output the correct answer.

## 10. Finding Satisfying Assignments for 2SAT

A Boolean formula consists of 
- Boolean variables denotes by $a,b,c, \cdots, z$ which can take values $0,1$
- not operations which flip the value  of the variable denoted by $\neg a$.
- or $||$, and $\\&$ operations.  

A *satisfying assignment* to a Boolean formula is an assignment of $0,1$ values to the variables,
such that the formula evaluates to $1$.    See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra)

For example:
$$ (\neg a||c)~\\&~(\neg a||\neg d)~\\&~(b||\neg d)~\\&~(b||\neg e)~\\&~(c||\neg e)~\\&~(\neg a||\neg f)~\\&~(b||\neg f)~\\&~(c||\neg f)~\\&~(d||g)~\\&~(e||g)~\\&~(f||g)$$
The assignment $a = 0, b = 1, c = 1, d = 1, e = 1, f = 1, g = 1$ is a satisfying assignment to the above formula, since if you make this substitution and evaluate the expression, 1 is obtained.  

Note that in the Boolean formula above, there are 11 terms in brackets, outside which there is and $\\&$ operation. Inside the bracket a variable or a negated variable is or ed $||$ with another one. Formula of this form are called 2SAT.   

Write a program which takes a 2SAT formula as input and outputs/prints a satisfying assignment to the formula.  

Note: The algorithm only needs to be correct.


## 11. Student Database

You are tasked with creating a program to manage a student database. The program should allow users to dynamically add, display, and delete student records. Each student record should include a student ID, name, and age. The program should use dynamic memory allocation for storing student records.  

**Requirements:**  

Implement a menu-based program with the following options:
- Add Student: Dynamically allocate memory for a new student record and prompt the user to enter the student's details (ID, name, and age).  
- Display Students: Display a list of all students in the database, including their details.
- Delete Student: Prompt the user to enter a Student ID and delete the corresponding student record from the database.
- Exit: Terminate the program.  

Use structures to represent a student's details. Implement dynamic memory allocation for storing student records. Use pointers to navigate and manipulate the dynamically allocated memory. Use functions to modularize the code (e.g., separate functions for adding, displaying, and deleting student records).  

Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

// Structure to represent a student
struct Student {
    int id;
    char name[50];
    int age;
};

// Function to add a new student
void addStudent(struct Student** database, int* numStudents) {
    // Your implementation goes here.
}

// Function to display all students
void displayStudents(struct Student* database, int numStudents) {
    // Your implementation goes here.
}

// Function to delete a student
void deleteStudent(struct Student** database, int* numStudents, int idToDelete) {
    // Your implementation goes here.
}

int main() {
    struct Student* studentDatabase = NULL;
    int numStudents = 0;
    int choice, studentIdToDelete;

    do {
        printf("\nStudent Database Management System\n");
        printf("1. Add Student\n");
        printf("2. Display Students\n");
        printf("3. Delete Student\n");
        printf("4. Exit\n");
        printf("Enter your choice: ");
        scanf("%d", &choice);

        switch (choice) {
            case 1:
                addStudent(&studentDatabase, &numStudents);
                break;
            case 2:
                displayStudents(studentDatabase, numStudents);
                break;
            case 3:
                printf("Enter the Student ID to delete: ");
                scanf("%d", &studentIdToDelete);
                deleteStudent(&studentDatabase, &numStudents, studentIdToDelete);
                break;
            case 4:
                printf("Exiting the program...\n");
                break;
            default:
                printf("Invalid choice. Please enter a valid option.\n");
        }

    } while (choice != 4);

    // Free dynamically allocated memory before exiting
    free(studentDatabase);

    return 0;
}
```
Feel free to modify the problem or add additional features to suit your needs.


## 12. Employee Database

You are tasked with developing a simple employee database system in C. The program should be capable of performing the following operations:  

- Add Employee:  
Prompt the user to enter the employee's details (Employee ID, Name, Position, and Salary).  
Add the employee to the database.  
 
- Display Employees:  
Display a list of all employees in the database, including their details.  
  
- Search Employee:  
Prompt the user to enter an Employee ID.  
Display the details of the employee with the given ID if found; otherwise, show a message indicating that the employee was not found.  
  
- Update Salary:  
Prompt the user to enter an Employee ID.  
If the employee is found, allow the user to update the salary for that employee.  
  
- Delete Employee:   
Prompt the user to enter an Employee ID.  
If the employee is found, remove the employee from the database.  
  
- Exit:  
Terminate the program.  
  
**Requirements:**  
- Use structures to represent an employee's details.  
- Implement dynamic memory allocation for storing employee records.  
- Use functions to modularize the code (e.g., separate functions for adding, displaying, searching, updating, and deleting employees).

## 13. Sudoku Solver

You are tasked with implementing a program that solves a Sudoku puzzle (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)). Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9, such that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.  

Your program should take a partially filled 9x9 Sudoku grid as input, where zeros represent empty cells. The goal is to fill in the empty cells such that the Sudoku puzzle is solved.  

**Requirements:**
- Implement a function solveSudoku that takes a 9x9 integer array representing the Sudoku grid and solves the puzzle in place.
- The input grid will be given as a function parameter.
- The solved Sudoku grid should be displayed as the output.  
  
Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void printSudoku(int sudoku[9][9]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
            printf("%d ", sudoku[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}

int main() {
    int sudoku[9][9] = {
