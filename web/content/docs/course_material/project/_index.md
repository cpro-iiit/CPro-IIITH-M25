# Project (Ungraded)

In the project, you will use all the features of C language and a few more new tools (git, make) to build a game. You will be given some basic code, with tasks for implementing certain functions. The project will help you build your confidence in large-scale programming with 1000+ lines of code. We will provide reference material for learning useful tools like git/make. You must learn some of these yourself (TAs could volunteer to help). 

**Project Repositories:** All documentation regarding the project will be available at the repositories bellow. Students not registered for bonus marks, can clone the repository, try to solve the problem and test it in their local computer. Registered students will have to push their changes to their assigned repos in github.
