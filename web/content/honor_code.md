# Honor Code

Any form of plagiarism in the Assignments or in the Lab Exams would be heavily penalised and would lead to a 0 score for both students, the student who copied and the one whose code was copied. It is solely your duty to ensure the safety of your code throughout the course .Thus, we will not be entertaining any requests after a student is found guilty of plagiarism.
